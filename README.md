# 🛡️ SecureVault Login Manager

A practical **Kotlin console application** demonstrating all **five scoped functions** — `let`, `run`, `apply`, `with`, and `also` — through a real-world scenario of a secure login and system verification process.  

---

## 🚀 Overview

`SecureVault Login Manager` simulates a login environment where:
1. A **user** object is created and configured.
2. Actions are **logged** for auditing.
3. The system performs a **security scan**.
4. User data is **validated** safely.
5. A **dashboard** is displayed for successful logins.

It’s a simple yet powerful way to understand **Kotlin scoped functions in action**, built for learners, developers, and educators alike.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

| Function | Purpose | Behavior | Returns |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| `apply` | Initialize / setup object | Access with `this` | The object itself |
| `also` | Log side effects | Access with `it` | The object itself |
| `run` | Execute block and return result | Access with `this` | Lambda result |
| `let` | Transform or validate safely | Access with `it` | Lambda result |
| `with` | Operate on non-null object | Access with `this` | Lambda result |

---

## 💼 Real-World Analogy

| Function | Real-Life Role | Example |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| `apply` | Filling your ID form | Configure user details |
| `also` | CCTV log entry | Log login attempt |
| `run` | Security scan | Check system safety |
| `let` | Guard validation | Verify credentials |
| `with` | Vault access | Open user dashboard |
